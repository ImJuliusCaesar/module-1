## Introduce yourself

Before we begin - tell us a bit about yourself.

- What's your name? 
> My name is Cesar Contla.

- Where and what do you study? 
> I study aerospace engineering at Orange Coast College of Costa Mesa, California.

- What are your hobbies? 
> My hobbies include gaming, running, and racing. 

- What's your story? Why are you interested in building communities? 
> My story is one of lost opportunities. The community that I grew up in only ever attained certain educations. 
For example, I wanted to learn how to code in middle school/junior high through high school, but we never had those 
opportunities available to us that we could use as our motivation to learn new skills. I want to build a community not 
so much for other students around my age (college), as much as I would like to create a community for those kids who are 
as old as I was when I first wanted to code with secific targets on those kids who can't afford any opportunities. 

## Community Description

How would you describe your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:

- Is it a computer science club or special interest group?

- Is it a formally recognized community such as a student society, or is it an informal community such as a friendship group?

- Does your community share interests or an environment?

- How long has your community existed?

- How big is your community? Has it always been this size?

## What are your community's shared struggles?

- What are the problems that is or will bring your community members together? They can be anything, but are commonly focussed around working towards better skills, grades or jobs. The following prompts might help:

- What problem does your community solve?
- What attracts members to your community?
- What does your community provide that members can't get elsewhere?
- What are the issues that these students face, that are solved (or partially solved) from them joining your community? 

## What is the mission of your community?
 - Based on your community's shared struggled, what is your community's mission? Keep this short and snappy.
- Note: this is not your personal mission, but the overarching mission of your community. An example of a mission might be `'Our aim is the equip everyone, regardless of their major, with technical skills to increase their job prospects.'`

## What do members look to get from your community?

### Activities

- How often do you run these activities?
- Are they events or projects? They can be both.
- How will these further your mission?

### Communication

- How will you get in touch with your community?
- How will they keep in touch with each other?
